# ![JMMC logo](https://github.com/JMMC-OpenDev/.github/blob/main/doc/JMMC-logo.jpg) OpenDev - SearchFTT-ranking
This repository gathers 2 python modules estimating GPAO strehl ratio &amp; GRAVITY noise estimations to compute SearchFTT's ranking score.

- **ASPRO_NGS** (GRAVITY+ AO NGS strehl) from Dr. Anthony Berdeu (OBSPM)
  - License: GPL3 (see ASPRO_NGS folder)
  - This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101004719.
- **asproGravFT.py** (GRAVITY+ SNR) based on ASPRO2's data and source code, made in collaboration with Dr. Taro Shimizu's Gravity+ simulator (MPE)
